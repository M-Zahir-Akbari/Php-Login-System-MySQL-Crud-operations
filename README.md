## Database Setup

The application uses a MySQL database. You can set up the database and populate it with sample data using the provided SQL script.

1. Create the database and tables:

   ```sql
   DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS uni;

   CREATE DATABASE uni;

   USE uni;

   -- Create the users table for authentication
   CREATE TABLE users (
       user_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
       password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
   );

   -- Insert sample users (teacher and student)
   INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('teacher', 'hashed_password_teacher');
   INSERT INTO users (username, password) VALUES ('student', 'hashed_password_student');

   -- Create tables for teachers, subjects, and students
   CREATE TABLE Teachers (
       teacher_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       teacher_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE Subjects (
       subject_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       subject_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       teacher_id INT NOT NULL,
       FOREIGN KEY (teacher_id) REFERENCES Teachers(teacher_id)
   );

   CREATE TABLE Students (
       student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       student_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );

   -- Insert sample data for teachers, subjects, and students
   INSERT INTO teachers (teacher_name) VALUES ('Dr. Hassan Adelyar');
   -- Insert more teachers and students as needed

   INSERT INTO students (student_name) VALUES ('Abdul Musawer Dinzad');
   -- Insert more students as needed
   ```

2. Make sure to replace `'hashed_password_teacher'` and `'hashed_password_student'` with actual hashed passwords for your users. You can use a password hashing library to generate secure hashed passwords.
